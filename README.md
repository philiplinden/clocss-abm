# clocss-abm
an Agent-Based Model of Heterogeneous Lunar Networks for the Cislunar Open Clock Synchronization System (CLOCSS)

## Abstract
This project aims to use agent-based modeling and simulations to explore how network topology and time synchronization evolve in a growing lunar ecosystem. Modeling how the approach may be used in practice and at scale informs decisions about how to architect a robust cislunar PNT system that scales with the population.
