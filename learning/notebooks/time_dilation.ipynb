    "# Time Dilation by Example\n",
    "Let's apply our knowledge of Special Relativity (SR) and General Relativity (GR) to predict the phenomenon of time dilation.\n",
    "\n",
    "Special Relativity, which describes spacetime far from a significant gravity field, explains how a stationary observer perceives time passing slower for a moving observer when the relative velocity between them is very large.\n",
    "\n",
    "General Relativity, which deals with gravity, explains how time slows down in proximity to a large gravitational acceleration.\n",
    "\n",
