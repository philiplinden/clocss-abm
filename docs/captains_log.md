# Captain's Log

## 2023-11-10 - PL
Objective: block out the project structure.

### Summary
- Initialized the project metadata and dependencies with Python Poetry
- Added docs via MkDocs
- Set up a working example from [mesa-examples](https://github.com/projectmesa/mesa-examples/tree/main/examples/virus_on_network)

### Notes
I know it's too early to really have documentation or a package manager but
Poetry and MkDocs are so easy so might as well. Besides, they make the whole
project feel so professional, so there's really no reason not to.

As for [Mesa](https://mesa.readthedocs.io/en/stable/overview.html), the examples
library is great for validating the setup and establishing a boilerplate project
setup. The website also has [Best Practices](https://mesa.readthedocs.io/en/stable/best-practices.html)
but it's basically just "use a readme and these file names".
