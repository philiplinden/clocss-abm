# Code Organization

This project contains Python implementations and Rust implementations.

## Python
Preliminary explorations were done in Python using the Mesa framework and the
Python package from nyx-space. You can find some iPy notebooks and Mesa models
that showcase elements of these packages, along with code reference thereof.
